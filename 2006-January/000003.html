<PRE>Hello and happy new year!

the 'stable' branch of Psychtoolbox has
been updated again, actually before
christmas, but i forgot the announcement.

Stable contains a subset of the features
available in 'beta'. All features of beta
that are considered well-tested and stable
enough for general consumption are in there.
These are the features that will definitely be
part of PTB 1.0.7:

* All bug-fixes from 'beta' and
'Psychtoolbox-1.0.6', including KbName - warning.

* OpenGL low-level transformation
support. Currently implemented:
Screen('glPushMatrix'), glPopMatrix,
glLoadIdentitiy, glScale, glTranslate
and glRotate.

These functions allow to apply arbitrary
sequences of translations, rotations and
scaling to all drawn shapes and images.
To use them properly you'll need to read
chapter 3 of the OpenGL Programming
guide though. A link to the online book
is displayed as part of the online help of
all these new commands.

See here:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.rush3d.com/reference/opengl-redbook-1.1/chapter03.html">http://www.rush3d.com/reference/opengl-redbook-1.1/chapter03.html</A>&gt;

A simple demo 'DrawSomeMirroredTextOSX'
illustrates how to use this to draw mirrored
text...

If you just want to draw rotated images, then
the 'rotationAngle' parameter of
Screen('DrawTexture') is the recommended way,
because this allows PTB to optimize drawing.

* The new Screen('PreloadTextures') command:

This command allows you to upload your textures
into the fast VRAM of your graphics card before a
trial starts. This command shouldn't be necessary
for most purposes, but in case you need to do
ultra rapid stimulus presentation it may give you a bit
improved timing. But caution: If used in the wrong
way, e.g., trying to upload more textures to VRAM
than fit into it, it may also screw up your presentation
timing.

Basic rule of thumb for memory consumption of textures:

For pure luminance textures (Grey level images):

mem in MB = width * height / 1024 / 1024

For all other (Luminance+Alpha, RGB, RGB+Alpha):

mem in MB = 4 * width * height / 1024 / 1024

If your gfx-card has 128 MB VRAM, then using 100 MB
for textures should be possible.

* Arc drawing functions 'DrawArc' 'FrameArc' and
'FillArc' plus a demo named ArcDemoOSX donated
by Kerstin Preuschoff (Caltech) as known from OS-9
PTB.

* A couple of new demos, most notably the
GazeContingentDemoOSX. This demo generates
a gaze contingent display: The area around the
center of fixation is displayed differently than the
periphery. &quot;Fovea&quot; and periphery are blended into
each other via a flexible weight mask - currently
a gaussian aperture. Due to lack of an eye-tracker
the current mouse pointer position is used as center
of fixation. The demo makes clever use of alpha
blending to achieve this at high frame rates,
currently up to 180 frames per second on a
PowerMac G5 1.6 Ghz with NVidia GeforceFX 5200
graphics card. My local prototype can go up to
400 Hz on the same hardware.

* Quicktime movie playback support: Fully implemented.
Works very reliable when Matlab is started in -nojvm
mode, aka from a terminal window with something
like &quot;matlab -nojvm&quot;. In normal mode with user
interface, Matlab tends to hang sometimes when
playing back some movie formats, e.g., MPEG-1
movies. This has been tracked down to be not a
bug in Psychtoolbox, but a bas interaction between
Apple's Quicktime toolkit and Matlabs JVM, so there
isn't much we can do about it.

The PsychDemos folder contains a subfolder
QuicktimeDemos with some demo scripts to show
how to use Quicktime playback:

* One demo on how to do simple playback with sound,
  at selectable speed and (with some movie formats)
  even backwards.

* One demo on how to play two movies simultaneously

* One demo on how to upload a whole movie into textures
   for full control over presentation timing and order.

* One demo with a fake experiment that collects
   reaction times for a task where subject needs to
   respond with a keypress when a specific event in
   the video happens. This shows the proper robust
   way of getting the most robust and accurate RT's
   possible for movies+sound.


Btw. the provided demo movie shows the collision of
two discs. The collision sound is delayed wrt. the
visual collision, so there isn't any audio-vido sync
problem but its the movie itself. If somebody happens
to have a similar short movie with matching sound+video,
feel free to contribute it!


What is missing with respect to the 'beta' branch?

* Support for the new stereo display algorithms like
Anaglyph stereo. This needs a bit more refinement but
will be ready soon.


Updating goes via the usual UpdatePsychtoolbox command
or via DownloadPsychtoolbox('stable') if you didn't do it
already. If you don't know what this means, read:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/kleinerm/ptbosx/">http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/kleinerm/ptbosx/</A>&gt;

This version needs at least OS-X 10.3.9 + Quicktime 7 installed!!!

I wish you a successfull and happy year 2006,
-mario
