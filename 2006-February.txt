Subject: [Osxptb-announce] NEW in Beta branch: Quicktime support for Windows
Message-ID: <43FFDB57.7030803@tuebingen.mpg.de>

Hi all,

apart from a few small bug fixes and improvements, the beta branch of 
Psychtoolbox has been updated with initial Quicktime movie playback 
support for Microsoft Windows. Quicktime demos can be found in the 
Quicktimedemos subfolder of the PsychDemos folder. They are the only and 
therefore best documentation on how to use it. Obviously you need to 
have Apples Quicktime for Windows installed to use it.

This is a beta-quality implementation that may contain some bugs or 
limitations. It has been successfully tested on two machines, but use 
with caution and prepare for a bumpy ride. This implementation is also 
not optimized for performance yet and Apples QT toolkit for Windows 
seems to be generally less well tuned than the OS-X version, so you'll 
probably need a recent PC if you want to play big movies without too 
many skipped frames. A good first test is always to play the movie in 
Quicktime player. If it plays back flawlessly it may also work well in 
PTB. If it doesn't, then it will be certainly worse in PTB.

good luck,
-mario
