<PRE>Hello,

the 'stable' branch of Psychtoolbox has
been updated. It now contains a subset
of the features available in 'beta'. All
features of beta that are considered
well-tested and stable enough for
general consumption are in there. These
are the features that will definitely be
part of PTB 1.0.7:

* All bug-fixes from 'beta' and 
'Psychtoolbox-1.0.6'

* OpenGL low-level transformation
support. Currently implemented:
Screen('glPushMatrix'), glPopMatrix,
glLoadIdentitiy, glScale, glTranslate
and glRotate.

These functions allow to apply arbitrary
sequences of translations, rotations and
scaling to all drawn shapes and images.
To use them properly you'll need to read
a chapter of the OpenGL Programming
guide though. A link to the online book
is displayed as part of the online help of
all these new commands.

A simple demo 'DrawSomeMirroredTextOSX'
illustrates how to use this to draw mirrored
text...

If you just want to draw rotated images, then
the 'rotationAngle' parameter of
Screen('DrawTexture') is the recommended way,
because this allows PTB to optimize drawing.

* The new Screen('PreloadTextures') command:

This command allows you to upload your textures
into the fast VRAM of your graphics card before a
trial starts. This command shouldn't be necessary
for most purposes, but in case you need to do
ultra rapid stimulus presentation it may give you a bit
improved timing. But caution: If used in the wrong
way, e.g., trying to upload more textures to VRAM
than fit into it, it may also screw up your presentation
timing.

Basic rule of thumb for memory consumption of textures:

For pure luminance textures (Grey level images):

mem in MB = width * height / 1024 / 1024

For all other (Luminance+Alpha, RGB, RGB+Alpha):

mem in MB = 4 * width * height / 1024 / 1024

If your gfx-card has 128 MB VRAM, then using 100 MB
for textures should be possible.

* Arc drawing functions 'DrawArc' 'FrameArc' and
'FillArc' plus a demo named ArcDemoOSX donated
by Kerstin Preuschoff (Caltech) as known from OS-9
PTB.

* A couple of new demos, most notably the
GazeContingentDemoOSX. This demo generates
a gaze contingent display: The area around the
center of fixation is displayed differently than the
periphery. &quot;Fovea&quot; and periphery are blended into
each other via a flexible weight mask - currently
a gaussian aperture. Due to lack of an eye-tracker
the current mouse pointer position is used as center
of fixation. The demo makes clever use of alpha
blending to achieve this at high frame rates,
currently up to 180 frames per second on a 
PowerMac G5 1.6 Ghz with NVidia GeforceFX 5200
graphics card. My local prototype can go up to
400 Hz on the same hardware.

What is missing with respect to 'beta' branch?

* Support for the new stereo display algorithms like
Anaglyph stereo. This needs a bit more refinement but
will be ready soon.

* Quicktime movie playback support: Works well in most
cases most of the time, but still produces occasional
hangs of Matlab. So if you need it, try it from beta,
but don't bet on it, especially not immediately
before deadlines approach ;-)

Updating goes via the usual UpdatePsychtoolbox command
or via DownloadPsychtoolbox('stable') if you didn't do it
already. If you don't know what this means, read:
