Subject: [Osxptb-announce] Bugfix Release 2 for Psychtoolbox 1.0.6 available
Message-ID: <web-16229695@tuebingen.mpg.de>

Hello everybody,

bugfix release 2 of Psychtoolbox 1.0.6 is available via
the automatic update service. If your are using
Psychtoolbox 1.0.6, downloaded via the DownloadPsychtoolbox
command, you can now upgrade to the latest
bugfix release by proper use of the UpdatePsychtoolbox.m
command ("help UpdatePsychtoolbox" is your friend ;) )

Please note that Psychtoolbox-1.0.6 only receives fixes for
important bugs. All performance improvements and new
features
are currently only available in the 'beta' branch and
soonish
in the 'stable' branch after final testing & polishing.

Psychtoolbox 1.0.6 is the last release that will work with
OS-X versions before 10.3.9.

The following bugs have been fixed / enhancements have
been made:

* Bug 5746 (Synctests failing in OpenGL stereo mode on ATI
hardware)
fixed by merging revision 72 of trunk. Screen now accepts a
flip-
interval that is twice as long as the display refresh
interval when
running in OpenGL flip-frame stereo mode, as this is normal
ATI
behaviour (different from NVidia behaviour).

Screen('GetFlipInterval') always reports the minimum
interval between
flips, not the monitor refresh interval, although both
values are
identical except the stereo case on ATI.

A message is displayed at Screen('OpenWindow') to alert the
user
about this behaviour if this situation is detected.

* Bug 5690 fixed by merging revisions 65 and 75 of trunk:

The fix was "corruption on 2nd display of a dual-display
setup" when
flipping first display on a gfx card with only 16 MB VRAM.
This is caused by an out-of-memory condition in that ATI
gfx card.

The new Screen('Preference', 'ConserveVRAM', 1) setting
allows to
work around this driver bug by disabling PTB's use of AUX
buffers,
thereby reducing VRAM memory demand.

* Bug in DownloadPsychtoolbox.m fixed: It ignored the
optional
targetdirectory argument. Merged bugfix revision 66 of
trunk

* Merged revisions 58-64 of trunk in order to fix many
broken
tests in PsychTests + VBLSynctest as well as some slightly
broken demos.

* New demos added to the PsychDemos folder which were
accidently
left out in the 1.0.6 release...

* RectOfMatrix.m fixed.

-> Still missing is the fix to make GetChar working.

Have fun,
-Mario Kleiner

Subject: [Osxptb-announce] Psychtoolbox Stable-branch updated...
Message-ID: <web-16261088@tuebingen.mpg.de>

Hello,

the 'stable' branch of Psychtoolbox has
been updated. It now contains a subset
of the features available in 'beta'. All
features of beta that are considered
well-tested and stable enough for
general consumption are in there. These
are the features that will definitely be
part of PTB 1.0.7:

* All bug-fixes from 'beta' and 
'Psychtoolbox-1.0.6'

* OpenGL low-level transformation
support. Currently implemented:
Screen('glPushMatrix'), glPopMatrix,
glLoadIdentitiy, glScale, glTranslate
and glRotate.

These functions allow to apply arbitrary
sequences of translations, rotations and
scaling to all drawn shapes and images.
To use them properly you'll need to read
a chapter of the OpenGL Programming
guide though. A link to the online book
is displayed as part of the online help of
all these new commands.

A simple demo 'DrawSomeMirroredTextOSX'
illustrates how to use this to draw mirrored
text...

If you just want to draw rotated images, then
the 'rotationAngle' parameter of
Screen('DrawTexture') is the recommended way,
because this allows PTB to optimize drawing.

* The new Screen('PreloadTextures') command:

This command allows you to upload your textures
into the fast VRAM of your graphics card before a
trial starts. This command shouldn't be necessary
for most purposes, but in case you need to do
ultra rapid stimulus presentation it may give you a bit
improved timing. But caution: If used in the wrong
way, e.g., trying to upload more textures to VRAM
than fit into it, it may also screw up your presentation
timing.

Basic rule of thumb for memory consumption of textures:

For pure luminance textures (Grey level images):

mem in MB = width * height / 1024 / 1024

For all other (Luminance+Alpha, RGB, RGB+Alpha):

mem in MB = 4 * width * height / 1024 / 1024

If your gfx-card has 128 MB VRAM, then using 100 MB
for textures should be possible.

* Arc drawing functions 'DrawArc' 'FrameArc' and
'FillArc' plus a demo named ArcDemoOSX donated
by Kerstin Preuschoff (Caltech) as known from OS-9
PTB.

* A couple of new demos, most notably the
GazeContingentDemoOSX. This demo generates
a gaze contingent display: The area around the
center of fixation is displayed differently than the
periphery. "Fovea" and periphery are blended into
each other via a flexible weight mask - currently
a gaussian aperture. Due to lack of an eye-tracker
the current mouse pointer position is used as center
of fixation. The demo makes clever use of alpha
blending to achieve this at high frame rates,
currently up to 180 frames per second on a 
PowerMac G5 1.6 Ghz with NVidia GeforceFX 5200
graphics card. My local prototype can go up to
400 Hz on the same hardware.

What is missing with respect to 'beta' branch?

* Support for the new stereo display algorithms like
Anaglyph stereo. This needs a bit more refinement but
will be ready soon.

* Quicktime movie playback support: Works well in most
cases most of the time, but still produces occasional
hangs of Matlab. So if you need it, try it from beta,
but don't bet on it, especially not immediately
before deadlines approach ;-)

Updating goes via the usual UpdatePsychtoolbox command
or via DownloadPsychtoolbox('stable') if you didn't do it
already. If you don't know what this means, read:

Subject: [Osxptb-announce] Bugfix-Release 3 for Psychtoolbox 1.0.6...
Message-ID: <web-16383634@tuebingen.mpg.de>

Hi,

i've just updated all branches of Psychtoolbox,
'Psychtoolbox-1.0.6', 'stable', and 'beta' to make
GetChar sort of work.

This is an improved version of the alpha-release of
Allen Ingling, but it still has problems and limitations:

* You can't interrupt GetChar with Ctrl-C

* If you open Matlabs M-File editor before first
invocation of GetChar, Matlab will hang when
trying to use GetChar. So better don't do it.

* If you activate other windows than the onscreen
window of PTB during a session (give them keyboard
focus), GetChar will fail. So i'd recommend using
GetChar the first time only *after* opening the
onscreen window and users of dual-display setups,
don't click around in the Matlab window or other
windows on your 2nd display when using GetChar.

* More unknown limitations? It worked for me under
these conditions, but i only did a quick test.

So give it a cautious try. If this isn't a workable
solution, we'll have to wait for Allen to finish his
next debug-cycle on GetChar - i can't do anything
about it, neither predict when this will happen...

Btw. people which have trouble with fMRI scanner
keyboard triggers (e.g, message 4086) and users
of the FORP, please try to query your devices via
GetChar. If they work with GetChar, that would
confirm the hypothesis mentioned in message
4088. And you can either use GetChar which has
higher response latency than KbWait/KbCheck, or
read the scanner manual/ask the manufacturer of
the scanner/the FORP to modify their devices so
that they send virtual keypresses of much longer
duration, e.g., >> 10 msecs -- as any real human
user would do with a real keyboard.

The update is available via the UpdatePsychtoolbox.m
file. If you don't know what this means, please read
the top of:

Good luck!
