<PRE>Hello,

the beta-branch has been updated. It contains a couple of bug-fixes, the 
most interesting ones:

a) Priority(): Two people reported difficulty with Priority(). I (hope 
i) made it slightly more robust, although i don't know if it fixes their 
problem.

b) PsychHID(): Two bugs were fixed that could cause crashes with the DAQ 
toolbox. Don't know if the fixed bugs were the causes of a few problems 
reported, because i didn't get feedback from the people that reported 
the problems.

The most interesting new feature is support for using OpenGL directly in 
Matlab. This allows you to use OpenGL functions in nearly the same way 
as you would usually do in the C programming language, so if you always 
wanted to do 3D computer graphics from Matlab, without entering the 
dangerous world of C/C++, this is your chance! The toolkit for 
OpenGL-for-Matlab support was developed and contributed by Prof. Richard 
F. Murray from York University, Canada -- Thanks a lot!!! I ported it 
over to M$-Windoze and GNU/Linux and made some smaller improvements.

In the folder Psychtoolbox/PsychDemos/OpenGL4MatlabDemos/ you'll find a 
couple of preliminary demos on how to use the new feature.

Typing &quot;help PsychOpenGL&quot; will give you more information, instructions, 
pointers on how to use it. We also provide higher-level helper functions 
for loading Alias/Wavefront OBJ geometry files and for fast rendering 
and morphing of 3D objects. Some nice demo for this feature &quot;MorphDemo&quot; 
was contributed by my colleague Quoc, C. Vuong. Thanks Quoc!

OpenGL support is beta and probably will have some small glitches, but 
we already use it here in the lab and all the basic stuff seems to work 
very well. If you find something missing, please report it.

Btw.: The OpenGL PTB for Windows has a nice feature to get your Matlab 
window back if your script aborted with an error: Press the @ key on 
your keyboard - This will execute Screen('CloseAll') for you...

Best,
-mario
